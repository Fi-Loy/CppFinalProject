This folder contains all of the header and source files and for the final project. You should be able to run it by writing "g++ *.cpp && ./a.out" to the console. A history of the development of this project can be found on my GitHub: https://github.com/Fi-Loy/CppFinalProject

NOTE: This was written on a Linux machine and uses system("clear") to clear the console. if you are using a windows machine, you need to replace this with system("cls") in the code. This adjustment should only have to be done in Main.cpp, and it is commented where this needs to be done.

NOTE: There is little input validation. For the program to work properly, you have to input the desired locations precisely. 

NOTE: as of the writing of this README, Expert Rules have not been implemented, only Expert Display.
